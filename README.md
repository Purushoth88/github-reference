## What?
This is a reference guide on how to use **GitHub for _non-technical people_**.

It is intended for people who will not be adding _code_ to GitHub but want to know how to
track a project's progress and **will be contributing mainly through _issues_**. 

## Why?
At dwyl, **we use GitHub to manage all our projects**.

We like to have a _'single version of the truth'_ where all communication happens in one place (rather than across email, chat systems, a project management tool, GitHub, etc).

Doing this means:
+ Everyone knows exactly where to look for _any_ information on the project
+ Information is always up to date 
+ Communications are transparent to the whole team
+ Progress is clear to the _whole_ team
+ There is a _full history/audit_ which anyone can access

We've created this reference guide to provide people who are not developers (and therefore less used to using GitHub) with the essential information they need to be able to **follow the progress of a project**, understand what they're seeing and **participate in the conversation**.



## To be answered (rough ideas for inclusion)
_Note: The sub-headings here are not specifically sub-headings, they are just points that need to be covered. They should be split out into the most logical sub-headings when written._

+ How to sign up
  + Note: must verify your email address or you will not be allowed to create or comment on issues
+ What is an organisation? Use https://github.com/dwyl as example
+ What is a repo - use folder analogy to explain
  + How to:
    + Get into a repo
    + Explain that you scroll to get to readme - what is a readme and what can you expect to see there?
    + Where is the code?
    + Rather than talking through the rest of the repo's UI, add a reference to terminology for main terms like 'pull requests', etc
+ Issues 
  + What are issues in the context of task management?
  + How to find issues (in the repo UI)
  + Issues list view explained
  + Creating a new issue
  + Various things you'll see on an existing issue, e.g. references from other issues and PRs, commits and everything is tracked (give example of assigning labels to an issue) 
  + Tips for commenting on issues
    + Referencing other issues
    + Mentioning specific people
+ Managing your notifications
  + What watching a repo means and how to do it
  + Manage email settings
+ Terminology
  + Look through repo UI, pull out the common terms and explain them in simple language
