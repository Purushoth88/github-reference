## What?
This is a reference guide on how to use **GitHub for _non-technical people_**.

It is intended for people who will not be adding _code_ to GitHub but want to know how to
track a project's progress and **will be contributing mainly through _issues_**. 

## Why?
At dwyl, **we use GitHub to manage all our projects**.

We like to have a _'single version of the truth'_ where all communication happens in one place (rather than across email, chat systems, a project management tool, GitHub, etc).

Doing this means:
+ Everyone knows exactly where to look for _any_ information on the project
+ Information is always up to date 
+ Communications are transparent to the whole team
+ Progress is clear to the _whole_ team
+ There is a _full history/audit_ which anyone can access

We've created this reference guide to provide people who are not developers (and therefore less used to using GitHub) with the essential information they need to be able to **follow the progress of a project**, understand what they're seeing and **participate in the conversation**.
